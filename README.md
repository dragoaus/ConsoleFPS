Console First Person Shooter Engine C# Implementation of javidx9 (OneLoneCoder)
Original YT video can be find https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8skO7MFYw

This implementation only partialy follows implementation of javidx9, since user input is handled differently

## Helpfull resources
- https://www.pinvoke.net/  => best place to look up unmanaged Windows APIs
- https://github.com/ZacharyPatten  => great source on getting console input
- https://gist.github.com/RobThree/f6af3c3b84173da183140344f3a325df => this project was also inspired by javidx9 video, but it uses different Window APIs, making it interesting implementation


## User Input 
A=>turn left, D=>turn right, W=>move forward, S=>move backward, Q=>strafe left, E=>strafe right
